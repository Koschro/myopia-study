# myopia-study
Myopia study project on data from the Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia (OLSM).

For the analysis a subset of data from the OLSM was used, a cohort study of ocular component development and risk factors for the onset of myopia in children. 

The ocular data come from a subjectâ€™s right eye. In detail, a total number of 618 observations from 18 different variables (17 possible predictive variables and 1 goal field) will be used for this analysis purposes.
