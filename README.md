Myopia study project on data from the Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia (OLSM)

For our analysis we collected a subset of the data from the OLSM, a cohort study of ocular component development and risk factors for the onset of myopia in children. 

The ocular data come from a subjectâ€™s right eye. In detail, a total number of 618 observations from 18 different variables (17 possible predictive variables and 1 goal field) will be used for this analysis purposes.
